## Your mission

For this project, you will be Pac-Man:

However, instead of just being a hungry yellow circle, you are an ethical hacker and you must defend your computer from attackers!

This is the situation: there is a huge problem with your computer system — it's being attacked by nasty viruses. These viruses are the Pac-Man ghosts:

|                                              |           |                                              |           |                                              |           |                                              |           |

Your goal is to catch and get rid of all of these ghosts! Once you have caught all the ghosts, you can go about collecting your treasure.

To catch the ghosts, you will need to navigate the maze that is your computer. You can navigate your Raspberry Pi computer by using **the command line**. The command line is a text interface for your computer that you can use to give commands to the computer's operating system. From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on maOS or Explorer on Windows. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based! The command line is a powerful tool, and with it you can run programs, write scripts to automate tasks, and combine simple commands to handle more difficult jobs.

So, to complete the treasure hunt you must:

1. Find the ghosts
1. Trap the ghosts
1. Collect your treasure

+ To access the command line on your Raspberry Pi, open a terminal window by clicking on the **Terminal** icon at the top of the screen, or select **Accessories** and then **Terminal** in the menu.
