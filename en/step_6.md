## Catch all the ghosts

--- task ---
Now use all the commands you have learned in the last two steps to move around your Pi's file system and find, catch, and quarantine as many ghosts as you can.

Here's a reminder of all the commands you need to navigate the terminal:

[[[command-line-navigation]]]

Tips:
1. Remember to copy the ghosts to the quarantine folder before removing them
1. Navigate to your quarantine folder to see how many ghosts you've caught
1. If you want to navigate into a directory with a name that has more than one word in it (for example `My Movies`), use a `\` before each blank space in the name (`cd My\ Movies`)
1. There are seven ghosts in total â€” can you catch them all?
--- /task ---

Once you have caught as many ghosts as possible, collect your treasure in the next step!
