## Challenge: get rid of the quarantine folder

Now that you have finished finding all the ghosts, you must clear your computer of any harmful files.

+ Delete the whole `quarantine` folder without copying any of the files in it. Use this link [www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/commands.md](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/commands.md){:target="_blank"} or look up online how to **recursively remove** a directory.

+ Check the folder has been deleted by listing the contents of your home directory.
