[[[command-line-navigation]]]

Tips:

1. Remember to copy the ghosts to the quarantine directory **before** removing them
2. Navigate to your quarantine directory to see how many ghosts you've caught
3. If you want to navigate into a directory with a name that has more than one word in it (for example `My Movies`), use a `\` before each blank space in the name (`cd My\ Movies`)
4. There are seven ghosts in total â€” can you catch them all? \--- /task \---
